# PHP Messaging System

This project is a simple **web-based messaging system** built with **HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQLite**.  
It allows registered users to send and receive messages from each other directly through the application, while also delivering those messages as **real emails** using [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/).

The project was built as an extension of a provided PHP framework and demonstrates a complete workflow for **user-to-user communication** — including frontend design, backend logic, database management, and email integration.
